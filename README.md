## *Introduction*  
Diabetes is a chronic health condition affecting millions worldwide. Understanding its risk factors can help in early detection and prevention. This project analyzes a diabetes dataset to explore the relationships between various health indicators and diabetes outcomes. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to uncover key insights.

## *Dataset*  
The dataset used in this analysis contains health-related attributes such as:  

- *Pregnancies* ‚Äì Number of times a patient has been pregnant  
- *Glucose* ‚Äì Blood glucose concentration (mg/dL)  
- *Blood Pressure* ‚Äì Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)  
- *Skin Thickness* ‚Äì Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)  
- *Insulin* ‚Äì Serum insulin level (ŒºU/ml)  
- *BMI* ‚Äì Body mass index (kg/m¬≤)  
- *Diabetes Pedigree Function* ‚Äì A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history  
- *Age* ‚Äì Age of the patient  
- *Outcome* ‚Äì 0 (No diabetes) or 1 (Diabetes present)  

The dataset is sourced from the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

## *Data Cleaning Steps*  
To ensure data quality and accuracy, the following preprocessing steps were performed:  

1. *Handling Missing Values*  
   - Checked for missing or incorrect values (e.g., zero values in glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, and BMI).  
   - Replaced zeros with NaN where a zero was not a valid value.  
   - Filled missing values using the median of respective columns.  

2. *Checking for Duplicates*  
   - Verified if any duplicate rows existed and removed them if necessary.  

3. *Feature Scaling & Encoding*  
   - Standardized numerical features where necessary to improve analysis and visualization.

## *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
We used different visualizations to understand the dataset better:  

### *1. Distributions to Represent Dataset*  
- *Histogram:* Shows the distribution of numerical features.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc737d6f-6150-4bf4-8a40-a8f5fa93c03e)
- Each histogram shows the distribution of values for a specific feature in the diabetes dataset. Here‚Äôs what they reveal:



*Glucose Distribution*
	‚Ä¢	The histogram likely shows a right-skewed distribution (more values on the lower end).
	‚Ä¢	Higher glucose levels are seen in some individuals, which suggests that some have diabetes.
	‚Ä¢	The peak around 100 mg/dL likely represents normal fasting glucose levels.

üîé Insight: People with higher glucose levels are more likely to have diabetes.



*Blood Pressure Distribution*
	‚Ä¢	Likely bell-shaped (normal distribution) around 70‚Äì80 mmHg.
	‚Ä¢	Some individuals have very low values, which might be due to missing values imputed earlier.

üîé Insight: Blood pressure is generally balanced, but extremely low values might need further investigation.



*BMI (Body Mass Index) Distribution*
	‚Ä¢	Typically right-skewed, meaning higher BMI values are more frequent.
	‚Ä¢	A significant portion of individuals have a BMI > 25, which is considered overweight/obese.

üîé Insight: Higher BMI is a risk factor for diabetes.



*Age Distribution*
	‚Ä¢	Likely right-skewed, meaning most people in the dataset are younger.
	‚Ä¢	The dataset includes a wide range of ages, but more people are between 20‚Äì50 years old.

üîé Insight: Diabetes affects people of all ages, but older individuals are more at risk.



* Insulin Distribution*
	‚Ä¢	This histogram often shows a peak near zero due to missing/imputed values.
	‚Ä¢	Some individuals have extremely high insulin levels, indicating insulin resistance.

üîé Insight: Insulin levels are inconsistent. More analysis is needed to determine its role in diabetes risk.



*Skin Thickness Distribution*
	‚Ä¢	Likely right-skewed, meaning most people have lower skin thickness values.
	‚Ä¢	Some individuals have very high values, possibly indicating obesity-related factors.

üîé Insight: Skin thickness may correlate with BMI and fat distribution, which impacts diabetes risk.
Overall Interpretation:
	‚Ä¢	Glucose and BMI are key factors in diabetes risk.
	‚Ä¢	Older individuals and those with high insulin levels are more likely to be diabetic.
	‚Ä¢	Blood pressure and skin thickness vary, but they might contribute indirectly.
  
- *Pairplot:* Displays scatter plots of numerical features categorized by diabetes outcome.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/513c5387-fabc-465b-88bd-79233455bed8)
- The pairplot is a powerful visualization that shows the relationships between numerical features in your dataset while coloring data points based on the Outcome (Diabetes = 1, No Diabetes = 0).



What Each Part of the Pairplot Means:
	1.	Scatter Plots (Lower Triangle)
	‚Ä¢	Each scatter plot shows how two features relate to each other.
	‚Ä¢	If there‚Äôs a clear separation between the two classes (diabetic vs. non-diabetic), it means the feature combination is useful for prediction.
	‚Ä¢	Example: A strong trend between Glucose and Outcome means glucose is an important diabetes indicator.
	2.	KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) Diagonal Plots
	‚Ä¢	The diagonal shows KDE plots, which are smooth versions of histograms for individual features.
	‚Ä¢	The difference in KDE peaks between diabetic (1) and non-diabetic (0) groups shows how well that feature separates the two classes.
	‚Ä¢	Example: If diabetics have a higher glucose peak than non-diabetics, glucose is a strong predictor.
	3.	Corner=True
	‚Ä¢	This removes duplicate scatter plots, making the visualization cleaner.



Key Insights from the Pairplot

üîπ Glucose vs. Outcome
	‚Ä¢	If diabetic cases (red/orange) cluster at higher glucose levels, then glucose is a strong indicator of diabetes.

üîπ BMI vs. Outcome
	‚Ä¢	If diabetics generally have a higher BMI, it suggests that obesity is a risk factor for diabetes.

üîπ Age vs. Outcome
	‚Ä¢	If diabetics tend to be older, then age may be a contributing factor.

üîπ Glucose vs. BMI, Insulin vs. BMI, etc.
	‚Ä¢	If these pairs show a clear pattern or trend, it means these features are interrelated in determining diabetes risk.



Final Interpretation:
	‚Ä¢	Features like Glucose, BMI, and Age likely show clear differences between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
	‚Ä¢	If clusters overlap heavily (e.g., for Blood Pressure), that feature may not be a strong predictor.
	‚Ä¢	The pairplot helps visually confirm which features are most useful for detecting diabetes

- *Boxplot:*  
  - Compares feature distributions.
  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/728046c0-9bde-4184-b41a-e051b8897845)
  - Interpreting the Boxplot: ‚ÄúGlucose Levels by Diabetes Outcome‚Äù

This boxplot compares glucose levels between individuals with diabetes (Outcome = 1) and those without diabetes (Outcome = 0).



What the Boxplot Reveals:

1. Median Glucose Level (Middle Line in the Box)
	‚Ä¢	If the median glucose level for Outcome = 1 (diabetic) is significantly higher than for Outcome = 0 (non-diabetic), it confirms that higher glucose levels are associated with diabetes.
	‚Ä¢	Typically, diabetics have a median glucose level well above 126 mg/dL, which is the medical threshold for diabetes.

2. Interquartile Range (IQR - The Box)
	‚Ä¢	The box represents the middle 50% of glucose values in each group.
	‚Ä¢	If the diabetic group (Outcome = 1) has a higher and more spread-out IQR, it suggests that diabetics have more variation in glucose levels.

3. Whiskers (Lines Extending from the Box)
	‚Ä¢	The whiskers show how widely glucose levels vary.
	‚Ä¢	If the diabetic group has a wider range and extends much higher, it means some diabetics have extremely high glucose levels.
	‚Ä¢	The non-diabetic group (Outcome = 0) will likely have a narrower range, mostly below 126 mg/dL.

4. Outliers (Dots Outside the Whiskers)
	‚Ä¢	Outliers represent individuals with exceptionally high glucose levels.
	‚Ä¢	If there are many outliers in the diabetic group, it shows that some diabetics have extreme hyperglycemia.



Key Insights from the Plot:

‚úÖ Diabetics (Outcome = 1) have significantly higher glucose levels on average than non-diabetics (Outcome = 0).
‚úÖ The box for diabetics is shifted higher, meaning that most people with diabetes have glucose levels above normal thresholds.
‚úÖ If there is little overlap between the two groups, glucose is a strong predictor of diabetes.

  - nterpreting the Boxplot: ‚ÄúBMI Distribution by Diabetes Outcome‚Äù

The boxplot you created compares BMI levels between diabetic (Outcome = 1) and non-diabetic (Outcome = 0) individuals.



What the Boxplot Shows:
	1.	Median (Middle Line in the Box):
	‚Ä¢	Shows the average BMI for each group.
	‚Ä¢	If the median BMI for diabetics (Outcome = 1) is higher than for non-diabetics (Outcome = 0), it suggests that higher BMI is linked to diabetes.
	2.	Interquartile Range (IQR) - The Box:
	‚Ä¢	The box represents the middle 50% of BMI values for each group.
	‚Ä¢	If the diabetic group‚Äôs IQR is higher and shifted right, it means most diabetics have a higher BMI range.
	3.	Whiskers (Lines Extending from Box):
	‚Ä¢	These show the spread of BMI values in each group.
	‚Ä¢	Longer whiskers indicate greater variability in BMI.
	4.	Outliers (Dots Outside the Whiskers):
	‚Ä¢	Any dots outside the whiskers represent unusually high or low BMI values.
	‚Ä¢	If many high BMI outliers are in the diabetic group, it suggests that obesity plays a role in diabetes risk.



Key Insights from the Plot:

üìå Higher BMI is likely linked to diabetes if the diabetic group has a higher median and IQR than the non-diabetic group.
üìå If the distributions overlap a lot, BMI alone may not be enough to predict diabetes but still contributes.
üìå Outliers (extremely high BMI values) in the diabetic group might suggest that obesity is a major risk factor.

- *Countplot:* Shows the number of people with and without diabetes.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1da66604-3513-442e-866e-a3394fcef117)
- Interpreting the Countplot: ‚ÄúDiabetes Cases Distribution‚Äù

This countplot shows the number of individuals in each category of Outcome:
	‚Ä¢	0 (‚ÄúNo Diabetes‚Äù) ‚Äì Individuals without diabetes (Green).
	‚Ä¢	1 (‚ÄúDiabetes‚Äù) ‚Äì Individuals with diabetes (Red).



What the Countplot Reveals:
	1.	Class Imbalance
	‚Ä¢	If the bars are unequal in height, there is a difference in the number of diabetic vs. non-diabetic cases.
	‚Ä¢	If the ‚ÄúNo Diabetes‚Äù bar is much taller, then the dataset contains more non-diabetic individuals than diabetics.
	‚Ä¢	If the bars are balanced, then the dataset has a nearly equal number of diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
	2.	Potential Bias in Data
	‚Ä¢	If the dataset is heavily skewed towards one class (e.g., far more non-diabetic cases), machine learning models trained on this data may struggle to predict diabetes correctly.
	‚Ä¢	Solution: If the imbalance is too large, techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or weighting can be used to improve predictive accuracy.
	3.	Dataset Representativeness
	‚Ä¢	If the diabetic group is too small, it might not represent real-world diabetes cases accurately.
	‚Ä¢	A more balanced dataset is generally better for predictive modeling.



Key Insights from the Plot:

üìå If more people are non-diabetic, the dataset may be imbalanced, affecting model predictions.
üìå If both bars are similar in height, it means we have a well-distributed dataset.
üìå Diabetes cases are lower in number (in most datasets), but still significant.

- *Violin Plot:* Displays the distribution of age by diabetes outcome.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af6cb63f-2a41-4b7c-9519-a76713c551ee)
- This violin plot shows how age is distributed for people with and without diabetes (Outcome). It combines aspects of a boxplot and a KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) plot, making it useful for spotting differences in distribution.



Key Elements of the Violin Plot:
	1.	Shape & Width (Density Estimation)
	‚Ä¢	The wider sections show where most data points are concentrated.
	‚Ä¢	If the diabetic group (Outcome = 1) is wider at older ages, it means diabetes is more common in older individuals.
	2.	Median & Quartiles (Inner Quartile Lines)
	‚Ä¢	The inner white lines show the median and quartiles (like a boxplot).
	‚Ä¢	If the median age for diabetics is higher than for non-diabetics, it suggests that diabetes is more common among older individuals.
	3.	Split=True (Comparison Between Groups)
	‚Ä¢	The plot is split into two mirrored distributions for Outcome = 0 (non-diabetic) and Outcome = 1 (diabetic).
	‚Ä¢	If the diabetic distribution is more concentrated at older ages, it confirms that age is a significant factor in diabetes risk.



What This Plot Likely Shows:

‚úÖ Diabetes is more common in older individuals (if the diabetic side is wider at older ages).
‚úÖ The median age for diabetics may be higher than for non-diabetics.
‚úÖ Younger individuals have lower diabetes risk (if the non-diabetic group is wider at younger ages).



Final Insights:

üìå If the diabetic group‚Äôs distribution shifts toward older ages, age is a significant risk factor for diabetes.
üìå If both groups have similar distributions, age alone may not be a strong indicator.
üìå If there are outliers (long tails), it means some young individuals also develop diabetes, though it‚Äôs less common.

- *Heatmap:* Shows correlations between features.
- ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20092b42-7d78-437f-9e72-1514a14e3804)
- This heatmap visualizes the correlation between different features in your dataset. Correlation measures how strongly two variables are related (from -1 to +1):
	‚Ä¢	+1 ‚Üí Strong positive correlation (When one increases, the other increases).
	‚Ä¢	0 ‚Üí No correlation (No relationship between variables).
	‚Ä¢	-1 ‚Üí Strong negative correlation (When one increases, the other decreases).

The annot=True parameter ensures that the correlation values are displayed inside the heatmap.



Key Things to Look for in the Heatmap:

1. High Positive Correlations (Closer to +1)

üîπ Glucose vs. Outcome ‚Üí Likely high correlation (diabetics tend to have higher glucose levels).
üîπ BMI vs. Outcome ‚Üí If BMI is positively correlated, it suggests that obesity is a risk factor for diabetes.
üîπ Age vs. Outcome ‚Üí If age has a moderate correlation, older individuals are more likely to have diabetes.

2. High Negative Correlations (Closer to -1)

üîπ If any feature has a strong negative correlation with Outcome, it means that higher values of that feature decrease diabetes risk (rare in medical datasets like this).

3. Strong Feature Relationships (Non-Outcome Correlations)

üîπ Glucose & Insulin ‚Üí A strong positive correlation suggests that higher glucose levels lead to increased insulin production.
üîπ BMI & Skin Thickness ‚Üí If positively correlated, it suggests that individuals with higher BMI also have higher skin thickness measurements.
üîπ Blood Pressure & Age ‚Üí Older individuals typically have higher blood pressure.



Final Insights:

üìå Glucose is likely the strongest predictor of diabetes (Outcome).
üìå BMI and Age might also be significant predictors.
üìå Some features (like Blood Pressure) may have weak or no correlation with diabetes.
üìå If two features are highly correlated (e.g., Insulin & Glucose), one might be redundant in modeling.

- *BMI Impact:* Individuals with a higher BMI tend to have a higher risk of diabetes.  
- *Age Factor:* Older individuals have a higher probability of being diagnosed with diabetes.  
- *Feature Correlations:*  
  - Glucose has the highest correlation with diabetes.  
  - BMI and age also play significant roles in predicting diabetes risk.  

## *Conclusion*  
After performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the diabetes dataset, we observed key patterns and relationships between various health indicators and diabetes risk:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Glucose levels have the strongest correlation with diabetes, confirming that high glucose is a major risk factor.
2Ô∏è‚É£ BMI and Age also show a positive relationship with diabetes, indicating that obesity and older age increase diabetes risk.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The heatmap revealed strong relationships between some features, such as Glucose & Insulin, suggesting potential redundancies in predictive modeling.
4Ô∏è‚É£ The boxplots and violin plots showed clear differences in feature distributions between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, particularly in Glucose and BMI.
5Ô∏è‚É£ The countplot highlighted a class imbalance, with fewer diabetic cases than non-diabetic cases, which is important to consider when building predictive models.
